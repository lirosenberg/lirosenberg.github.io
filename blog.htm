<h2>My Food Adventures</h2>
     <p>I have been all over the country and beyond in my pursuit for good food. Here are some highlights.</p>
     <p>
 <a href="serendipity.htm" target="new"><img

 For my birthday in November 2017, I went to Serendipity 3 in the Upper East Side of Manhattan and had their world-famous frozen hot chocolate. It tasted like it was somewhere in between a hot chocolate and a milkshake, making it the perfect dessert for a chilly autumn day. I had been to the Boca Raton location before, but the NYC frozen hot chocolate definitely trumped the former. I would definitely go back!

 <a href="milkbar.htm" target="new"><img

 I have visited Milk Bar in NYC many times, but by far my favorite item I have ordered from there was the salted caramel-chocolate and cereal milk twist when I went to their Midtown location. It was garnished with corn flakes and was just the right amount of sweet and salty. The next time I am in Midtown, I will make sure to stop by again!
</p>

 <a href="homefrite.htm" target="new"><img
src="images/blog_images/homefrite.jpg" alt="truffle fries from home frite @smorgasburg"
width="80" height="142" border="0"></a>
 I went to the Smorgasburg food festival at its Williamsburg, Brooklyn location before camp in 2017 with my friends from school. Although there were countless dessert vendors that could have made the list, I decided that this savory post-lunch snack should instead. Home Frite's stand at Smorgasburg was incredibly popular, and I could definitely see why! The truffle fries I ordered were crisp and had enough flavor that kept me asking for more! I hope that one day they open a stand at Smorgasburg's LA location so I can get my hands on these fries again (without the 6 hour flight!)

      <a href="doughnutplant.htm" target="new"><img

 While I was at Grand Central Station in Manhattan, I knew I had to have the trendiest food that the Concourse had to offer. After enjoying my lunch from Shake Shack, I decided to get dessert at Doughnut Plant, where I ordered the Brooklyn Blackout cake donut (right) and my brother and sister shared the iconic Black & White cake donut. I have never had a better donut in my life! The donut's Valrhona chocolatey goodness even beat out the Apple Cinnamon cronut I had at Dominique Ansel Bakery in LA.
