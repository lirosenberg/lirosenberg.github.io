    <h1 class="article">Holy Matcha</h1>
    <p class="article">Holy Matcha is a trendy cafe and dessert place in <em>North Park, San Diego, CA.</em> I tried the Instagram-worthy eatery on April 7 and was more than impressed. Here are some highlights of the place.</p>
    <p class="article">The cafe offered a long list of lattes and baked goods, but I drifted towards their lemonades and ice cream. For my order, I got a matcha lemonade and Holy Matcha's signature matcha-coconut soft serve ice cream.</p>
    <p class="article">The food's presentation was amazing. The ice cream and lemonade matched the cafe's aesthetic to make a great picture for the 'gram. The lemonade even came in a mason jar (which is a plus for me).</p>
    <p class="article">Although the ice cream was slightly watered down, it still tasted just good enough to make it count. On the other hand, the lemonade was the perfect balance of tart and sweet.</p>
    <p class="article">As this was my first venture into North Park, it definitely piqued my interest. I love the neighborhood's feel and positively want to go back!</p>

        <h1 class="article">Absolute Zero</h1>
        <p class="article">Absolute Zero is a rolled ice cream shop in <em>Montclair, NJ.</em> It was the first of its kind in New Jersey. Since its opening, it has become a landmark of the artsy city's downtown.</p>
        <p class="article">As soon as you step in the building, you can tell that this is an extremely popular place. People from all around come to Absolute Zero to try their amazing, fresh-cream rolled ice cream. One of my favorites and go-tos at Absolute Zero is Camp & Chill, which I've had on many occasions.</p>
        <p class="article">Absolute Zero doesn't fail to impress with their toppings. On my s'mores-flavored rolled ice cream, I received a toasted marshmallow, graham crackers, and chocolate sauce. Altogether, they made a great arrangement.</p>
        <p class="article">Camp & Chill tastes exactly how you think it would - s'mores! The ice cream itself is crushed-up graham crackers, marshmallow, and chocolate mixed with sweet cream. Overall, the ice cream tasted very camp-y and, in my opinion, met up to its expectations.</p>
        <p class="article">Even though downtown Montclair has many restaurants with rave reviews like Toast, Mishmish, and Raymond's; Absolute Zero is a spot you should definitely stop by. The dessert place's 12 mix-and-match flavors will be worth your time!</p>
